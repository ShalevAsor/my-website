## Database Architecture

<Collapse title="Database Schema">

The database uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Key design decisions include:

**Core Models:**

- **User** - Synced from Clerk authentication
- **Note** - Main content with rich text and embeddings
- **Folder** - 3-level hierarchy for organization
- **Tag** - Many-to-many via NoteTag junction table

**Semantic Search Fields:**

```prisma
model Note {
  // ... other fields

  embedding          Float[]    // 1536-dimension vector
  embeddingUpdatedAt DateTime?  // Last embedding generation
  contentUpdatedAt   DateTime   // Track content changes
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Lazy Embeddings Strategy">
  Embeddings are generated **only when searching** AND **only for notes that
  updated after embedding generation**, not on note creation. This saves 90% of
  API costs and eliminates impact on note creation speed.
</Callout>

**Folder Hierarchy Rules:**

- Maximum 3 levels deep (depth: 0, 1, 2)
- Self-referential with `parentId`
- Cascade delete prevents orphaned folders
- Special "Inbox" folder with `isDefault: true`

**Tag System:**

- Always stored lowercase
- Unique per user (case-insensitive)
- Many-to-many relationship with notes

</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Architecture Patterns">

### State Management Strategy

<ProcessFlow
  variant="compact"
  steps={[
    "Database State → React Query",
    "UI State (global) → Zustand",
    "Form State (complex) → useReducer",
    "Form State (simple) → useState",
  ]}
/>

### Server Actions Pattern

All server operations follow a consistent pattern:

```typescript
export async function actionName(
  input: InputType
): Promise<ActionResult<ReturnType>> {
  try {
    // 1. Authenticate
    const userId = await requireAuth();

    // 2. Validate input
    const validated = zodSchema.parse(input);

    // 3. Database operation
    const result = await prisma.model.operation({
      where: { userId },
      data: validated,
    });

    // 4. Revalidate cache
    revalidatePath("/notes");

    // 5. Return typed success
    return createSuccessResult(result);
  } catch (error) {
    return createErrorResult({ error: "Failed" });
  }
}
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Why ActionResult?">
  Using a discriminated union type (`success: true | false`) instead of throwing
  errors makes error handling in components more predictable and type-safe.
</Callout>

<Collapse title="React Query Optimistic Updates">

One of the key patterns making the app feel instant is optimistic updates. When a user performs an action, we immediately update the UI before waiting for the server response.

**Example: Creating a Note**

```typescript
export function useCreateNote() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: createNote,

    // 1. Optimistic update (before server responds)
    onMutate: async (newNote) => {
      // Cancel outgoing queries to avoid race conditions
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: NOTES_QUERY_KEY });

      // Snapshot current state for rollback
      const previous = queryClient.getQueryData(NOTES_QUERY_KEY);

      // Immediately add note to cache
      queryClient.setQueryData(NOTES_QUERY_KEY, (old) => {
        return [...(old || []), optimisticNote];
      });

      return { previous };
    },

    // 2. Rollback on error
    onError: (err, variables, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(NOTES_QUERY_KEY, context?.previous);
      toast.error("Failed to create note");
    },

    // 3. Sync with server on completion
    onSettled: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: NOTES_QUERY_KEY });
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: FOLDERS_QUERY_KEY });
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: TAGS_QUERY_KEY });
    },

    // 4. Success feedback
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      toast.success("Note created!");
    },
  });
}
```

<Callout type="success" title="Why This Matters">
  Users see their changes instantly without waiting for the server. If the
  server fails, we rollback automatically. This creates a snappy, responsive
  experience that feels native.
</Callout>

**Result:** The UI updates in < 50ms instead of waiting 200-500ms for the server. If something fails, the user sees the error and the UI reverts gracefully.

## How Quick Capture Works

Quick Capture is the standout feature - it uses AI to analyze pasted content and automatically organize it.

<ImageGallery
  columns={2}
  images={[
    {
      src: "/images/projects/second-brain/quick-capture-1.png",
      alt: "Quick Capture modal",
      caption: "Quick Capture modal",
    },
    {
      src: "/images/projects/second-brain/quick-capture-2.png",
      alt: "Ai Analysis results",
      caption: "Ai Analysis results",
    },
  ]}
/>

<UserFlow
  steps={[
    "User opens Quick Capture modal (Cmd+Shift+C)",
    "User pastes content (code, notes, recipes, etc.)",
    "User clicks [Organize with AI]",
    "Fetch user's existing folders & tags for context",
    "Build AI prompt with folder hierarchy and tag list",
    "Call OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with structured JSON output",
    "AI analyzes content and suggests organization",
    "Parse response: title, folder path, tags, reasoning",
    "Match folder path to existing folders",
    "Pre-fill form with AI suggestions",
    "User reviews and edits if needed",
    "Format content: plain text → rich HTML",
    "Create folder if AI suggested a new one",
    "Create note with formatted content",
    "Navigate to note editor",
  ]}
/>

<Collapse title="AI Folder Logic">

The AI follows specific rules for folder suggestions:

**1. Prefer Existing Folders**

- Searches for semantic matches in user's folder structure
- Prefers most specific match (e.g., "Algorithms/Sorting" over "Algorithms")
- Case-insensitive, path-aware matching

**2. Create New Only at Root**

- If no match found, suggests NEW root-level folder
- Never suggests nested paths for new folders
- Example: "Recipes" (✅) not "Cooking/Desserts" (❌)

**3. Use Inbox for Vague Content**

- Generic or unclear content → suggest "Inbox"
- Prevents creation of useless folders like "misc" or "temp"

**Example:**

```
User pastes: Python merge sort code
Existing folders: Algorithms/Sorting, Recipes
AI suggests: "Algorithms/Sorting" ✅
```

</Collapse>

<Collapse title="AI Tag Logic">

**Tag Suggestion Rules:**

1. **Always reuse existing tags when relevant**

   - Prevents tag proliferation
   - Maintains consistency

2. **Add new specific tags for discoverability**

   - Balance: Broad existing + Specific new
   - Example: Hash table code + existing "algorithms" tag
   - Result: `["algorithms", "hash-table", "data-structures"]`

3. **Clear content: 2-5 tags, Vague content: 0-1 tags**

4. **Lowercase, hyphenated format**
   - "python" not "Python"
   - "hash-table" not "hash_table" or "hashtable"

</Collapse>

## Semantic Search Architecture

<ImageGallery
  columns={2}
  images={[
    {
      src: "/images/projects/second-brain/semantic-search-1.png",
      alt: "Sematic search",
      caption: "Sematic search - first search (generate embeddings)",
    },
    {
      src: "/images/projects/second-brain/semantic-search-2.png",
      alt: "Sematic search",
      caption: "Sematic search - second search (embeddings already generated)",
    },
  ]}
/>

The search system uses "lazy embeddings" - a cost-effective approach that generates embeddings on-demand.

<Callout type="success" title="Why Lazy Embeddings?">
  **Benefits:** - Zero impact on note creation speed - First search: 2-3s
  (generates embedding for all notes) - Subsequent searches: 300ms (uses cached)
  - 90% cheaper after first search - No background jobs needed , generate
  embeddings for new and updates notes only
</Callout>

### Search Flow

<ProcessFlow
  steps={[
    "User searches: 'how to sort arrays'",
    "Fetch all notes with embedding metadata",
    "Check embedding freshness for each note",
    "Identify stale notes (content changed since last embedding)",
    "Prepare texts: strip HTML, combine title + tags + content",
    "Generate embeddings for stale notes (parallel batches of 10)",
    "Generate query embedding",
    "Calculate cosine similarity (query vs all notes)",
    "Filter by threshold (30% minimum)",
    "Sort by similarity (highest first)",
    "Return top 20 results",
    "Save new embeddings to DB (background, non-blocking)",
  ]}
/>

### Embedding Freshness Logic

The system intelligently decides when to regenerate embeddings:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Needs Regeneration">

<TechStack
  items={[
    "No embedding exists - First time searching this note",
    "Missing timestamp - Corrupted metadata",
    "Content updated - contentUpdatedAt > embeddingUpdatedAt",
    "Wrong dimensions - Should be 1536, might be corrupted",
  ]}
/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Fresh (Use Cache)">

<TechStack
  items={[
    "Has embedding - Not null or empty",
    "Has timestamp - embeddingUpdatedAt exists",
    "Content unchanged - contentUpdatedAt <= embeddingUpdatedAt",
    "Correct dimensions - Exactly 1536 floats",
  ]}
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Stats>

## Challenges & Solutions

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 1: Form State Complexity"
  problem="Note editor has 5+ interdependent fields (title, content, folder, tags, favorite). Using multiple useState hooks led to sync issues and complex update logic."
  solution="Implemented useReducer pattern with typed actions. Single source of truth for form state, predictable updates, easier to test. Created noteFormReducer with actions like SET_TITLE, ADD_TAG, TOGGLE_FAVORITE, LOAD_NOTE."
  result="Cleaner code, fewer bugs, easier to add new fields. Form state updates are now predictable and testable."
/>

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 2: Search Performance"
  problem="Generating embeddings on note creation was slow (2-3s per note) and expensive. Users had to wait after every note save, terrible UX."
  solution="Implemented lazy embeddings - generate only when searching. Cache embeddings in database with freshness tracking. Regenerate only when content changes. Added batch processing for multiple notes."
  result="Zero impact on note creation. First search is slower but subsequent searches are 10x faster. 90% cost reduction after initial search."
/>

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 3: Folder Path Matching"
  problem="AI suggests paths like 'Algorithms/Sorting' but database stores flat structure with parentId. Needed to match AI suggestions to existing folders."
  solution="Built recursive path building function that traverses parent relationships. Created findFolderByPath() that builds paths for all folders and matches case-insensitively. Returns deepest match (most specific)."
  result="AI suggestions now correctly match existing nested folders. Users get accurate pre-fills in Quick Capture."
/>

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 4: Auto-Save Race Conditions"
  problem="Saving on every keystroke caused too many API calls. Not saving enough risked data loss. Race conditions when user types fast."
  solution="Implemented 2-second debounced auto-save with cleanup. Only saves if note already exists (createdNoteId). Cancels pending saves when user types again. Shows 'Last saved' timestamp for confidence."
  result="Smooth editing experience. No API spam. No lost data. Users see visual confirmation of saves."
/>

<Challenge
  title="Challenge 5: Tag Normalization"
  problem="Users entered tags inconsistently: 'Python', 'python', 'PYTHON' created duplicates. Case-sensitive matching failed. Hard to search and filter."
  solution="Enforce lowercase storage in database. Normalize all tag inputs to lowercase in server actions. Case-insensitive unique constraint. Display tags in lowercase everywhere."
  result="No duplicate tags. Consistent search/filtering. Better user experience. Follows industry standards (GitHub, Stack Overflow)."
/>
